I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at UNC Chapel Hill. My research focuses on household interaction and child skill development. I have also had the great fortune of publishing (with wonderful coauthors!) multiple papers in environmental economics.

In my job market paper, I develop and estimate a dynamic model of parent-child interaction that features time allocation and parenting style decisions and the consequences these choices have on the development of the cognitive and non-cognitive skills of children.
