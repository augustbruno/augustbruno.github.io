I am a fifth year Economics PhD student at UNC Chapel Hill. My research focuses on household interaction and the development of child skills. Additionally, I have published (with some wonderful coauthors!) multiple papers in the climate and energy fields.

When I'm not working on my research you can probably find me on my bike, hiking, or at the nearest record store.
